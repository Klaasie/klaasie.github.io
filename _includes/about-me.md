Hi, I'm Klaas Poortinga, a backend developer at [Van der Let & Partners](https://www.vdlp.nl){:target="_blank"} and tech enthusiast located in Heerenveen, Netherlands.  
Over the past 10 years I've gained experience with various languages used in the field of building websites and applications. During this time I specialized in PHP using (mostly) the laravel framework.


In the past few years I've gotten more involved in the opensource community. Providing [new features and bugfixes](https://github.com/octobercms/october/commits?author=klaasie){:target="_blank"} to the laravel based CMS called [OctoberCMS](https://www.octobercms.com){:target="_blank"}.
And [recently](https://github.com/code16/sharp/commits?author=klaasie){:target="_blank"} to a more recent CMS system called [Sharp](https://sharp.code16.fr/docs/){:target="_blank"}.  
In addition to this I've released my first open source package: [A laravel scout driver for Apache Solr](https://github.com/Klaasie/laravel-scout-solr-engine){:target="_blank"} and my first mobile app called [Keep Slim!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=frl.klaas.diet){:target="_blank"}. Keep Slim! is an app to track calorie in take and give a visual representation to your set goal.

Beyond programming, I'm frequently found both watching and playing football ‚öΩ, Gaming with friends üéÆ and occasionally brewing my own beer üç∫.
